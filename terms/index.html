        <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
    
        <p>
            This page explains our terms of use and service. In order to create your
            account you must agree to all of the rules in this page. It's important
            for you to read and understand them before start using the site, therefore, 
            I'll do my best to explain them as clearly and shortly as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
            Those can be changed from time to time. If that happens, I'll let you know what 
            has changed and when those changes go into effect.

        <h3>2. MyChessOpening Services</h2>

        <p>
            The main purpose of this site is to provide a useful analysis of the chess openings 
            a certain player has been playing recently on its chess games at <b>chess.com</b> or 
            <b>lichess.org</b>
        </p>
        <p>
            This analysis will tell the user which openings are working well (making it win the games),
            and what opening it should avoid playing.
        </p>
        <p>
            MyChessOpening DOES NOT have any association with any of these two websites, it has
            been created by users of these sites.
        </p>

        <h4>2.1 The data for the analysis </h4>

        <p>
            The data used to offer such analysis is the most recent chess games of the
            chosen player.
        </p>
        <p>
            All data used to perform that analysis is public, acessible for anyone on the
            internet, I've just created a program to gather all of them automatically and apply
            an algorithm to interpret that data.
        </p>
        <p>
            They are obtained using the <a href="https://lichess.org/api" target="blank">lichess.org API</a> 
            and <a href="https://www.chess.com/news/view/published-data-api" target="blank">chess.com API</a>
        </p>
        <p>
            If a chess player has created an account in any of these sites, it has automatically agreed to
            share his games on the internet so that anyone can gather and use it as they want.
        </p>

        <h4>2.2 The results of the analysis </h4>

        <p>
            After an analysis is finished, its results are saved in MyChessOpening's database and an unique 
            <b>analysis id</b> is generated allowing the results to be shared with anyone on the internet. 
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition to the results, the name of the user who requested the analysis and 
            the date and time that the analysis was requested are also saved and displayed on the
            results page.
        </p>

        <h3>3. Privacy policy</h3>

        <p>
            This privacy policy describes how the personal information you provide on
            MyChessOpening collected, protected and used. 
        </p>
        <p>
            By "personal information" I'm refering to any kind of information that may be 
            used to identify who you are, your contact info or what you do on this website.
        </p>

        <h4>3.1 Account information</h4>

        <p>
            In order to create its account, the user must provide the following information:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>An username (that doesn't need to be its real name)</li>
            <li>Its email adress</li>
            <li>A password</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>3.1.1 Why do they need to provide those information</h5>
        
        <p>
            The username is needed to identify the user inside MyChessOpening, in other words:
            is what he wants to be called in here.
        </p>
        <p> 
            The email adress is my way to comunicate to the user to perform account confirmation or
            password reseting.
        </p>
        <p>
            The password is necessary to ensure that only the creator of that account will 
            be able to access that account, inserting a password that only he/she knows.
        </p>

        <h5>3.1.2 How these data are stored</h5>

        <p>
            Those account informations are stored in a private database, only the admin of the site
            has access to that database, and he will never share this access with anyone.
        </p>
        <p>
            The password is hashed before its storage, ensuring that even in case of a leak or a invasion,
            the invader won't know the password for your account.
        </p>

        <h5>3.1.3 Why is an account necessary</h5>
        <p>
            The user must create an account in order to use our services.
        </p>
        <p>
            The choice to restrict the services on MyChessOpening only for those who have an
            was taken in order to reduce the traffic inside the website, thereby reducing the
            chances of an attack.
        </p>

        <h5>3.1.4 Account deletion</h5>

        <p>An account can be completely deleted from the website in one of these cases: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The user has an offensive username</li>
            <li>The user has been flooding analysis (requesting the same analysis all the time)</li>
            <li>At the admin's wish</li>
        </ul>
    </body>
