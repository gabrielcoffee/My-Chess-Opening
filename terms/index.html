        <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
            
        <p>
            This page explains our terms of use and service. In order to create your
            account you must agree to all of the rules in this page. It's important
            for you to read and understand them before start using the site, therefore, 
            I'll do my best to explain them as clearly and shortly as possible.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Those can be changed from time to time. If that happens, I'll let you know what 
            has changed and when those changes go into effect.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            In this text you'll find MyChessOpening's <b>privacy policy, cookie policy,
            user's rights and source code license</b>.
        </p>

        <h3>2. MyChessOpening Services</h2>

        <p>
            The main purpose of this site is to provide a useful analysis of the chess openings 
            a certain player has been playing recently on its chess games at <b>chess.com</b> or 
            <b>lichess.org</b>
        </p>
        
        <p>
            This analysis will tell the user which openings are working well (making it win the games),
            and what opening it should avoid playing.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            MyChessOpening DOES NOT have any association with any of these two websites, it has
            been created by users of these sites.
        </p>

        <h4>2.1 The data for the analysis </h4>

        <p>
            The data used to offer such analysis is the most recent chess games of the
            chosen player.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            All data used to perform that analysis is public, acessible for anyone on the
            internet, I've just created a program to gather all of them automatically and apply
            an algorithm to interpret that data.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            They are obtained using the <a href="https://lichess.org/api" target="blank">lichess.org API</a> 
            and <a href="https://www.chess.com/news/view/published-data-api" target="blank">chess.com API</a>
        </p>
        
        <p>
            If a chess player has created an account in any of these sites, it has automatically agreed to
            share his games on the internet so that anyone can gather and use it as they want.
        </p>

        <h4>2.2 The results of the analysis </h4>

        <p>
            After an analysis is finished, its results are saved in MyChessOpening's database and an unique 
            <b>analysis id</b> is generated allowing the results to be shared with anyone on the internet. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            In addition to the results, the name of the user who requested the analysis and 
            the date and time that the analysis was requested are also saved and displayed on the
            results page.
        </p>

        <h3>3. Privacy policy</h3>

        <p>
            This privacy policy describes how the personal information you provide on
            MyChessOpening collected, protected and used. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            By "personal information" I'm refering to any kind of information that may be 
            used to identify who you are, your contact info or what you do on this website.
        </p>

        <h4>3.1 Account information</h4>

        <p>
            In order to create its account, the user must provide the following information:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>An username (that doesn't need to be its real name)</li>
            <li>Its email adress</li>
            <li>A password</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>3.1.1 Why do they need to provide those information</h5>
        
        <p>
            The username is needed to identify the user inside MyChessOpening, in other words:
            is what he wants to be called in here.
        </p>
        
        <p> 
            The email adress is my way to comunicate to the user to perform account confirmation or
            password reseting.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The password is necessary to ensure that only the creator of that account will 
            be able to access that account, inserting a password that only he/she knows.
        </p>

        <h5>3.1.2 How these data is stored</h5>

        <p>
            Those account informations are stored in a private database, only the admin of the site
            has access to that database, and he will never share this access with anyone.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The password is hashed before its storage, ensuring that even in case of a leak or a invasion,
            the invader won't know the password for your account.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Even though I use great efforts to protect these data, I cannot guarantee
            its absolutely security, but if I become aware that a data breach has happened in MyChessOpening
            I'll make reasonable efforts to to notify affected individuals if we believe that there is 
            a reasonable risk of harm to the user as a result of the breach.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            If that happens, I'll post a notice on the website and send you an email.
        </p>

        <h5>3.1.3 Why is an account necessary</h5>
        
        <p>
            The user must create an account in order to use our services.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The choice to restrict the services on MyChessOpening only for those who have an
            account was taken in order to reduce the traffic inside the website, thereby reducing 
            the chances of an attack.
        </p>

        <h5>3.1.4 Account deletion</h5>

        <p>An account can be completely deleted from the website in one of these cases: </p>
        
        <ul>
            <li>The user has an offensive username</li>
            <li>The user has been flooding analysis (requesting the same analysis all the time)</li>
            <li>At the admin's wish</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>3.2 Your activity inside the website</h5>

        <p>
            MyChessOpening opening will storage the following information regarding
            what you do inside the website:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Whether you are logged in any device</li>
            <li>When you logged in</li>
            <li>The analysis you requested and when you requested them</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>3.2.1 Why do I keep those info</h5>

        <p>
            Those data are used to personalise and improve your own experience on the website
            and it will never be used to marketing purposes.
        </p>

        <h4>3.3 How long this data will be stored</h4>

        <p>
            Apart from the login data, every other kind of data saved is stored indefinitely
            and will only be deleted in one of these cases:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>If MyChessOpening be deactivated</li>
            <li>If something disastrous happens to the server</li>
            <li>If forced before the law</li>
            <li>If the admin wants to</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            But to prevent losing this data in case of a catastrophe in the server,
            a backup is made monthly so MyChessOpening can come back on air if someday
            I goes down.
        </p>

        <p>
            Only the admin and the people he wants to have an access to those backups.
        </p>

        <h5>3.3.1 The login data</h5>

        <p>
            A login has the validity of one year, so a year after the submition of these data, 
            they'll be deleted.
        </p>

        <h4>3.4 How is this info collected from the user</h4>

        <p>
            MyChessOpening will never collect any data from the user without its agreement, 
            which means that the website will only collect data from the user if they freely
            decide to submit it.
        </p>

        <p>
            Submit data means to click the "Ok", "Send", "Test", "Register", "Login" and other buttons
            that appear at the end of a formulary. Only if the user takes that action, the data will
            be collected.
        </p>

        <h4>3.5 Third parties</h4>

        <p>
            MyChessOpening doesn't sell user information with any company, however, I use
            trusted third party services such as <b>Google Analytics</b> to provide me
            useful analytics services. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Therefore, other companies can collect data from your access including <b>IP adress</b> and
            <b>your behavior inside the website</b>.
        </p>

        <p>
            I may also disclose personal and non-personal information about you to government or 
            law enforcement officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe
            necessary or appropriate in order to respond to claims, legal process (including subpoenas),
            to protect our rights and interests or those of a third party, the safety of the public 
            or any person, to prevent or stop any illegal, unethical, or legally actionable activity,
            or to otherwise comply with applicable court orders, laws, rules and regulations.
        </p>

        <p>
            You acknowledge and agree that MyChessOpening shall not be responsible for any Third-Party
            Services, including their accuracy, completeness, timeliness, validity, copyright compliance,
            legality, decency, quality or any other aspect thereof. MyChessOpening does not assume and 
            shall not have any liability or responsibility to you or any other person or entity for 
            any Third-Party Services.
        </p>

        <p>
            Still it's important to emphasize that the data collect for third party won't be used for
            any commercial puporses and won't be sold to any company. It'll only be used by the admin and
            people related to him in order to keep up with the website statistics.  
        </p>

        <h5>3.5.1 Why is my IP adress being collected</h5>

        <p>
            It is used to estimate general location and other technographics such as connection
            speed, whether you have visited the website in a shared location, and type of the
            device used to visit the website.
        </p>

        <h4>3.6 Privacy of children</h4>

        <p>
            MyChessOpening doesn't check if the user's age, so I may collect data from children under
            the age of 13, with or without its parents' supervision.
        </p>

        <p>
            There isn't any content that might harm the physical, psychological and moral integrity of
            the child, but anyway I encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children's 
            Internet usage and to help enforce this Policy by instructing their children never to provide
            Personal Information through the Website and Services without their permission. 
        </p>

        <p>
            If you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 13 has provided Personal 
            Information to us through the Website and Services, please <a href="#contactinfo">contact me</a> 
        </p>

        <p>
            If I become aware that We have collected Personal Data from anyone under the age of 13
            without verification of parental consent, We take steps to remove that information 
            from Our servers.
        </p>
